# PinSpoof

Displays a pin prompt to steal a user's pin on computers with smart card authentication. Designed to mimic HID ActivID ActivClient pin prompt. Currently just logs an entered pin locally but can be modified to communicate with C2 server or integrate with another credential stealing tool like mimikatz.
